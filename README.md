# siRNABERT
An explainable BERT-based deeplearning algorithm for siRNA target prediction 

## Introduction
In this study, we propose an explainable BERT-based model for the siRNA target prediction. We show that our model takes advantage of the pre-training model from a large number of human genomic sequences could help us achieve the state-of-the-art performance in siRNA prediction.
